# Simple Bootloader Project

This is a basic x86 bootloader project that demonstrates the fundamentals of OS development. The bootloader prints "Hello, boot world!" to the screen using BIOS interrupts.

## Project Structure

- `bootloader.asm` - The main bootloader source code written in x86 assembly
- `bootloader.bin` - The compiled binary bootloader image
- `bochs_config.bxrc` - Configuration file for the Bochs emulator

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you'll need:
- FASM (Flat Assembler) for compiling the assembly code
- Bochs x86 emulator for running the bootloader

## Building

To compile the bootloader, run:
```bash
fasm bootloader.asm bootloader.bin
```

## Running

To run the bootloader in Bochs:
```bash
bochs -f bochs_config.bxrc
```

## Technical Details

The bootloader:
- Is loaded by BIOS at memory address 0x7C00 (a fixed address chosen by IBM in 1981)
- Runs in 16-bit real mode
- Uses BIOS interrupt 0x10 for video output (specifically function 0x0E for teletype output)
- Includes the standard boot signature (0x55, 0xAA) which marks the sector as bootable
- Fits within the required 512-byte size for boot sectors
- Uses null-terminated strings for text output
- Automatically pads the binary to exactly 512 bytes, with the last two bytes being the boot signature
